NAME
    Win32::Useful - Collection of useful functions that extend Win32
    functionality

FUNCTIONS
  IsLastError( $errorcode )
    Checks whether or not *Win32::GetLastError()* is equal to the the given
    errorcode. Returns a *True* value if they are equal, 0 otherwise.

    Compares the values as unsigned values, so you do not have to cope with
    *Win32::GetLastError()* returning a signed integer.
